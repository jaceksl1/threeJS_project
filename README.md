# threeJS_project

In this prodject I created with:
React - React Three Fiber - a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React
ThreeJS - a powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating the 3D model
TailwindCSS - a popular utility-first CSS styling framework
Framer Motion - the most popular library used to bring your React website to life with animations

You can create your own design of the 3D model t-shirt:
- add your logo
- pick a color
- set logo as small or as large
- set design as a whole t-shirt and add logo on the top
